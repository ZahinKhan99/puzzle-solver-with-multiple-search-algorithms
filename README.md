It is a Python-based project that solves two classic puzzles:

8-Puzzle Solver: Solves the 8-puzzle using multiple search algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and A\* Search with a Manhattan distance heuristic).

This puzzle solver allows users to enter their own puzzle setup and choose the algorithm to solve it. They can see the time taken for the algorithm to solve the puzzle, including the number of nodes expanded for the 8-puzzle

Features

Algorithm Selection: Choose from BFS, DFS, or A\* for the 8-puzzle

Custom Input: The program asks the user to enter the puzzle setup using the command line.

Performance Metrics: Displays results including the solution, nodes expanded (for 8-puzzle), and execution time.

Modular Design: The code is organized so it's easy to update and add new features.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Input Format
8-Puzzle: Enter 9 numbers (1-8 and 0 for the blank space) separated by spaces.
